# US-Citizenship
If you are considering applying for U.S. citizenship, an important step in the process is the Civics Test, conducted during your naturalization interview. This portion of the test is oral, and a USCIS officer will ask you up to 10 questions from a list of 100 official civics questions. You must answer at least 6 correctly to pass.

This app is designed to help you learn all 100 questions and their answers with ease. The user-friendly interface allows for smooth navigation, provides state-specific questions and answers, includes interactive flashcards, and supports both light and dark modes. Whether you're just starting or reviewing before your interview, this app is a valuable companion on your journey to becoming a U.S. citizen!

The app uses information sourced directly from the official [USCIS website](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/find-study-materials-and-resources/study-for-the-test).
